#summary Things to be aware of when using html5media.

= Known limitations =

For the vast majority of uses, *html5media* will just work out of the box with no complications. However, if you intend to do more advanced work using HTML5 video tags, read on...

==Dynamically inserted video tags==

The *html5media* script is run automatically when your page loads. However, if you use Javascript to create your own HTML5 video tags dynamically, these might not be caught by the script.

To ensure that dynamically-inserted video tags are usable in all browsers, you must run the following line of code whenever you've finished inserting video tags.

{{{
html5media()
}}}

==No support for audio tags==

At some point, I intend to update *html5media* to support HTML5 audio tags. When I get some time off commercial work, it'll go in. Until that point, feel free to pester me about this on the [http://groups.google.com/group/html5media project mailing list].

==No support for scripting video tags==

Because some browsers will have their video tags replaced with Flash video players, if you try to call [http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#htmlmediaelement HTMLMediaElement] javascript methods on the video tag then it won't work in all browsers.

It would be lovely if *html5media* could set up these fallback Flash video players with an emulated javascript API. Maybe one day I'll do just this. Until then, I'm just a human, and have to sleep sometimes!
