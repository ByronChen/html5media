#summary How html5media does its magic.

= How it works =

The *html5media* script checks whether your browser supports both the HTML5 video tag and the h.264 and MPEG-4 codecs. If it does, the script does nothing. This is currently the case for Google Chrome, Safari, iPhone and Android phones.

If your browser does not support HTML5 video, then the video tags are dynamically replaced with a [http://flowplayer.org/ Flowplayer] instance, providing the same functionality as the original video tag.

There is currently no support for videos encoded using [http://www.theora.org/ Theora]. I'm aware of the controversy surrounding the issue, and can see the obvious merits of Theora. However, it's more important that a single format is supported across the internet, and there are a great many influential companies putting their weight behind h.264.
