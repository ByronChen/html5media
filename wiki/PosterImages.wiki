#summary How to use poster images in your videos.

= Poster Images =

It is highly recommended that you add a splash image to all your video tags. This gives people something to see while the rest of the video downloads. Simply use the poster attribute as follows:

{{{
<video src="video.mp4" width="320" height="240" poster="image.jpg" controls autobuffer></video>
}}}

For consistant behaviour between browsers, the poster image should be taken from the first frame of the video.

==What do you mean, consistant behaviour?==

Unfortunately, different browsers interpret this value im different ways. Firefox will show this image to the user until they press the play button, whereas Chrome and Safari will instantly replace the image with the first frame of the video once it has loaded.

There's a [http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/html5_video_unusable bit of a debate] going on about this at the moment. As far as I'm concerned, Firefox is currently the only browser that is handling this attribute correctly.
