=Getting Started=

To enable HTML5 video tags in all major browsers, simply paste the following code into the `<head>` of your document:

{{{
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://html5media.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/jquery.html5media.min.js"></script>
}}}

If you're already using [http://jquery.com/ jQuery 1.4] in your page, then you can leave the first line out. Just be sure to include *html5media* underneath your own jQuery declaration.

==Video tag syntax==

HTML5 video tags can be embedded using the following syntax:

{{{
<video src="video.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls autobuffer></video>
}}}

You can control the behaviour of the video by including the following optional attributes:

  * *controls* - Add a set of controls to the video.
  * *autobuffer* - Start downloading the video automatically.
  * *autoplay* - Start playing the video automatically.
  * *loop* - Keep playing the video in a loop.

==Adding a splash image==

It is highly recommended that you add a splash image to all your video tags. This gives people something to see while the rest of the video downloads. Simply use the `poster` attribute as follows:

{{{
<video src="video.mp4" width="320" height="240" poster="image.jpg" controls autobuffer></video>
}}}

==Hosting your own html5media==

If you don't trust Google Code to host the files used by *html5media*, then don't worry. Simply [http://code.google.com/p/html5media/source/checkout checkout] the code and copy the `src` folder onto your own webserver. You can then link to your own copy rather than the one hosted on Google Code. Just be sure to keep all the *html5media* files in the same folder, and it should all work just fine.
