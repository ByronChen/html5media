#summary How to use html5media in your document.
#labels Featured

=Getting started=

To enable HTML5 video tags in all major browsers, simply paste the following code into the `<head>` of your document:

{{{
<script src="http://html5media.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/html5media.min.js"></script>
}}}

If you're already using [http://jquery.com/ jQuery 1.4] in your page, then you can leave the first line out. Just be sure to include *html5media* underneath your own jQuery declaration.

==Video tag syntax==

HTML5 video tags can be embedded using the following syntax:

{{{
<video src="video.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls autobuffer></video>
}}}

You can control the behaviour of the video by including the following optional attributes:

  * *controls* - Add a set of controls to the video.
  * *autobuffer* - Start downloading the video automatically.
  * *autoplay* - Start playing the video automatically.
  * *loop* - Keep playing the video in a loop.

==Adding a splash image==

It is highly recommended that you add a splash image to all your video tags. This gives people something to see while the rest of the video downloads. Simply use the `poster` attribute as follows:

{{{
<video src="video.mp4" width="320" height="240" poster="image.jpg" controls autobuffer></video>
}}}

For consistent behaviour between browsers, the poster image should be taken from the first frame of the video. See PosterImages for more information.

==Styling video tags==

It is important not to directly style the video tags in your document using CSS. This is because browsers that do not support video tags will have them replaced by a [http://www.flowplayer.org Flash video player].

To style your video tags using CSS, simply assign them a `class` or an `id`, and attach CSS style rules to that. The replacement Flash video player will have the same `id` and `class` as the video tag, so will pick up the same style rules.
